                The presence of autonomous systems and their projected increased penetration in the global market thereby creates a need to thoroughly understand how to test autonomous systems and in ensuring their safe operations based on the fact that they interact
                with humans without human supervision. This project is a work in progress in identifying a framework addressing the concepts and methodologies that help to understand and test autonomous systems across domains. The presence of autonomous
