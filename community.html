                        <p>
                            The presence of autonomous systems and their projected increased penetration in the global market thereby creates a need to thoroughly understand how to test autonomous systems and in ensuring their safe operations based on the fact that they interact with humans without human supervision. This project is a work in progress in identifying a framework addressing the concepts and methodologies that help to understand and test autonomous systems across domains. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Towards this end, with a goal of first understanding how autonomous systems are perceived, this project is an the initial effort in exploring contributions by researchers addressing foundational, engineering, and technological aspects related to autonomous systems with the help of the topic mining, enabling to identify the concepts and methodologies inferred upon in relation to autonomous systems.

                        <p>
                            Several aspects of the modern emerging technologies are tied to the digital world. Digitalization and automation add a great value to current technologies such as automatic industrial handling systems, automated manufacturing and quality control systems, and several more. We are currently in the midst of the transition in the way products are produced, and tested, thanks to this digitization. This transition (Industry 4.0) represents the current revolution in manufacturing, with the help of computers, automation, and virtual and augmented reality technologies. To keep up with this emerging domain, the goal is looking to explore innovative ways through the power of visualization and

                        <p>
                            simulation models to help and understand ideas to bring concepts to life for allowing better decision making and assisting industrial and manufacturing processes. This will involve developing Virtual and Augmented reality environments to assist industry training and quality control techniques. The set of projects will be focused on: (1) creating 3D immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications at the intersection of Additive Manufacturing (3D printing), (2) automated assembly and disassembly operations, and (3) industrial quality control using visual applications including visual positioning, measurement, detection, and recognition.

                        <h1>Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE): Identifying threshold to benchmark the translation of industry requirements to workforce development</h1>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of this research is to understand the current perception and use of MBSE
techniques and tools in industries and academia. Towards this effect the approach is framed for industry professionals, researchers, and academic faculty, to identify the tools required and current need for training the future workforce in MBSE tools and techniques. The main goal for this effort to sever as a threshold to benchmark the translation of industry requirements to university curricula for effectively training future manufacturing and production engineers. In addition, another objective of the effort is to understand the generational divide and the resistance toward adopting the use of MBSE techniques in industries.
