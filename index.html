                    <h1>Profile Summary</h1>
                    <p>Dr. Akundi is an Assistant Professor of engineering technology, within the Department of Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering in the College of Engineering and Computer Science. His research is centered on the use of and tailoring the concepts from information theory, specifically geared towards complex and complicated systems. This involves a multidisciplinary approach based upon a given complex system in scenarios such as: exploring complex human-centric networks towards finding effective strategies for efficient dissemination; network analysis for understanding network structural coherence, software systems, and complex networks. From an industrial and manufacturing perspective, this includes exploring and understanding relational aspects of manufacturing technologies, systems, and enterprises to establish an approach for identifying commonality.</p>
