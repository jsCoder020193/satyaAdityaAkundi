                    <h1>ENGT 3300 Systems Simulation and Optimization</h1>
                    <p>
                        The main focus of this course will be to introduce students to the current simulation-based optimization technologies. Student will be introduced to Simulation of Intelligent Objects (SIMIO) a multi-paradigm modeling tool that combines the simplicity
                        of objects with the flexibility of processes to provide a rapid modeling capability without requiring programming. The concepts that will be covered are: Basics of Simulations, Logics and Methodologies, Developing Simulation Models,
                        Analysis of Simulation Data, applications to Industrial, Manufacturing, and service system designs. Co/Prerequisites: ENGT 2310 and MATH 1342 (or MATH 1387).</p>

                    <p>
                        This course familiarizes students with Total Quality Management principles, methods and practices. Statistical Quality Control, including probability and statistics, control charts for variables and attributes, and acceptance sampling are covered. Co/Prerequisites:
                        ENGT 2310 and MATH 1342 (or MATH 1387).</p>

                    <h1>ENGT 4210 Technical Project 1 (Junior Design)</h1>
                    <p>The ENGT junior design course is primarily intended as a culminating engineering design experience in solving real world problems. Therefore, student deliverables are engineering design oriented. Students will be working on a semester
                        long project. Each member of the team is expected to spend approximately 4 hours per week working on the project â€“ 8 to 12 hrs. per week per team depending on the number of members per team.</p>

                    <h1>ENGT 3300 Introduction to Systems Design and Engineering</h1>
                    <p>This course addresses the basic concepts of systems engineering to provide the students the basic knowledge to facilitate transformation of operational needs to a well-defined system. The course provides a platform to discuss processes
                        and activities performed by systems engineers. As a part of the course, students will review the iterative design process of problem formulation, analysis, optimization, design synthesis, system integration, and testing. At the
                        end of the course the students will be able to compare systems engineering life cycle models from INOCSE, DOD, IEEE and NASA, apply systems thinking and systems engineering tools to a project, structure the steps in the systems
                        engineering process starting with stakeholder analysis and ending with transitioning systems to operations, apply some of the fundamental methods and tools of systems engineering to a simple Cyber, Mechanical, Robotic systems as
                        an experience to more complex and real world projects.</p>
